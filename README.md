# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The goal of this project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.


The script run_analysis.R does the following:
 - Downloads and loads the datasets into R
 - Extracts only the measurements for mean and standard deviation
 - Merges the train and test datasets
 - Labels activities and variables using descriptive names
 
The file CodeBook.md describes the following:
 - Data
 - Variables
 - Transformations

The text file contains the tidy data that is the result of the process done in run_analysis.R.
