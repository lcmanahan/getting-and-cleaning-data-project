# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The goal of this project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The script run_analysis.R does the following:
 1. Downloads and loads the datasets into R
 2. Extracts only the measurements for mean and standard deviation
 3. Merges the train and test datasets
 4. Labels activities and variables using descriptive names
